## Log of Development and Deployment

This file documents each major step taken during the development and deployment of the Fair Car Insurance Price Calculator.  Entries are appended chronologically.

### 13 Aug 2025 – Project setup

* Initialized the `fair-insurance-app` directory with separate `server` and `client` folders.
* Created `server/package.json` defining the Node.js dependencies (`express` and `cors`) and a start script.
* Implemented `server/index.js` to expose a simple REST API at `/api/quote`.  The API computes a fair price based on vehicle age, driver age, accident history and city risk factor, clamping the result between 600 and 3000 SAR.  Five offers are generated by applying random modifiers between −12 % and +18 %.
* Built the frontend in `client/index.html` using Bootstrap 5 for a responsive RTL/LTR design.  Added a form to collect user inputs and a results section with sorting and filtering capabilities.
* Added `client/app.js` to handle language toggling, form submission via fetch to the backend, dynamic rendering of the offers table, sorting, filtering and highlighting of the cheapest offer.
* Wrote a detailed `README.md` describing project goals, features, structure, local development instructions and deployment guidelines.

Further steps such as pushing to a public repository, deploying the backend and frontend, and updating configuration values will be logged once completed.
